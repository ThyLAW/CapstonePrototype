# Capstone Prototype

This is my prototype for my capstone, a **CI/CD** Pipeline using **Azure DevOps**. It utilizes [OWASP JuiceShop](https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop) as the base application. OWASP JS is an intentionally insecure web application. I chose it as it had everything I wanted for an initial test, and I may try to put security testing on it first.

I will be moving to a final capstone project repository soon with a new application or one built by me that is easier to fix!
